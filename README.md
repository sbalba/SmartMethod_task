# SM_AI-project
Special projects in artificial intelligence that I worked on at Smart Methods Company


The first project is to install ros on linux.

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools,  And it's all open source.
